# Title: Sales-Analysis of ECOMMERCE Business

Problem statement with analysis

 1. Sales Performance:
    - November shows the highest sales, while February has the lowest. Investigate the reasons for this seasonal variation. 
      Consider targeted promotions or inventory adjustments during the low season (February).
    - Focus on the top-performing product categories ('Technology' and 'Office Supplies'). Explore strategies to further boost sales in these areas.
    - Analyze the sub-category performance.  'Phones', 'Chairs', 'Storage', and 'Binders' are top performers.  Understand why these are performing well and leverage those insights.  Address underperforming sub-categories.
 2. Profitability:
    - Although 'Technology' brings in high sales, its profitability is relatively lower compared to 'Office Supplies'.  Investigate the cost structure for 'Technology' products and identify areas for improvement in profit margins.
    - Sub-categories like 'Copiers' and 'Machines' have high profit potential, but also seem to have high costs.  Analyze this carefully.  'Binders' and 'Paper' contribute positively to profit.
    - Focus on maximizing profits from 'Office Supplies' while optimizing the profitability of the 'Technology' segment.
 3. Customer Segmentation:
    - The 'Consumer' segment contributes the highest sales, but 'Home Office' shows a higher sales-to-profit ratio.  Investigate why and consider tailored strategies to increase the profitability of the 'Consumer' segment.
    - Consider targeted marketing strategies for each customer segment based on their profitability and sales potential.
 4. Overall Strategy:
    - Further investigate the relationship between sales and profit across different categories, sub-categories, and customer segments to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the business.
    - Use a more robust approach than just analyzing the highest and lowest values in each category. Analyze trends, correlations and potential causal relationships.
    - Implement data-driven decision-making to optimize pricing strategies, inventory management, marketing campaigns, and customer relationship management.
